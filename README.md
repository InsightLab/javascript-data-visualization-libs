D3.js
===================

Probably the most popular interactive DataViz library helping us to bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS.  
It's a solid and low-level data visualization library, being used as a core of the many others libraries.  
The D3 team/community has published hundreds of examples and tutorials over the last 10 years (you are not alone!)  
https://d3js.org  
https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery

React.js is a great library for developing web applications.  
D3 and React should be a pretty good choice to create a rich user interface for data visualization.  
There some options to integrate a D3.js chart within a React component without start a fight to control the DOM.  
Of course, each approach has both its own positive and negative side.

### D3 within a React component
This method is probably the most popular and simple way to integrate D3 within a React component.  
D3.js controls the DOM, but the mix with React code is not so good when the component becomes bigger.  
```javascript
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react"
import * as d3 from "d3"

export function BarChart({ data }) {
    const containerRef = useRef()
    
    useEffect(() => {
        const svg = d3.select(containerRef.current)
        svg.attr("viewBox", "0 0 100 100")
        const g = svg.append("g").attr("class", "group-bars")
        // ...
        g.select("rect.bar").on("click", event => { /* ... */ })
        // ...
    }, [data])

    return <div ref={ containerRef } />
}
```

### D3 chart on Facade Pattern
We can encapsulate our D3.js chart and export a few methods with a simple API.  
This method focuses on a clear separation between D3 and React code.  
Maintenance will be easier, flexible to use in another framework, and reuse community examples should be easier too.  
All D3.js features remain intact to use, but we need a well-defined interface to communicate.

```javascript
// only D3.js code (React is not allowed here)
import * as d3 from "d3"

export function createLineChart(container, data, options) {
    const svg = d3.select(container).append("svg")
    svg.attr("viewBox", "0 0 100 100")
    const g = svg.append("g")
    // ...
    g.select("path.line").on("click", onClick)
    // ...
    return {
        update: data => { /* update chart... */ },
        remove: () => { /* remove all subscription listeners... */ }
    }
}
```
```javascript
// only React code (D3 is not allowed here)
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react"
import { createLineChart } from "./createLineChart.js"

export function LineChartComponent({ data }) {
    const containerRef = useRef()
    const chartRef = useRef()

    useEffect(() => {
        if (!chartRef.current) {
            chartRef.current = createLineChart(containerRef.current, data)
        } else {
            chartRef.current.update(data)
        }
    }, [data])

    useEffect(() => {
        return () => chartRef.current.remove()
    }, [])

    return <div ref={ containerRef } />
}
```

### D3 for Math, React for the DOM
In this method, we use D3 as a simple utility library to generate scales, layouts, SVG paths, etc and React to manage the DOM.  
React developers will be happy but at the same time, they will need to reimplement/adapt D3 code to React way.  
D3 transitions should be replaced too by another library as react-spring, for example.
```javascript
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react"
import * as d3 from "d3"

export function LineChart({ data }) {
    const xScale = d3.scaleTime().domain // .domain(d3.max(data, ...
    const yScale = d3.scaleLinear().domain // ...

    const line = d3.line().x(d => xScale(d.date)) // ...
    const linePath = line(data)

    const clickHandler = () => {
        console.log("line clicked")
    }

    return (
        <svg width={ 300 } height={ 200 } viewBox="0 0 100 100">
            <path className="line" d={ linePath } onClick={ clickHandler } />
        </svg>
    )
}
```

    "description": "A basic chart",
    "width": 500,
    "height": 300,
    "padding": 10,
    "scales": [
        {"name": "xcale", "type": "linear", "range": "... etc."}
